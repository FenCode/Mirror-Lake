GENERAL GAME RULES:

4. (LAST PRIORITY) make a planet platform; islands in the lake, stars can't move past the planets

5. visual cues for correct star placement (sung)
	- glowing star when not locked in place
	- not glowing star when locked in
6. adjust star radius so it's easier to lock stars in //DONE
